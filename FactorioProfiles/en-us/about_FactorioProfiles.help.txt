SHORT DESCRIPTION
    Explains how the FactorioProfiles module can be used to manage multiple
    Factorio profiles.



OVERVIEW
 == This module manages multiple Factorio profiles. A Factorio profile can be
    described as a set of configuration files, mods, saves, and other items
    which the game loads in at runtime, and which contain user-created content.

    An example use of this module would be to have a separate profile for
    'vanilla', 'a multiplayer game with certain mods', and a 'modded save'.
    These three profiles can share the config file, so that the keybinds and
    game settings remain the same across all profiles. However, they have
    separate mod and save folders since the profiles are incompatible with 
    each other.


 == This module has custom-defined formatting outputs for:
        -------	        -----
        Cmdlet	        Alias
        -------         -----
        Format-List     fl
        Format-Table    ft
        Format-Custom   fc
        Format-Wide     fw
    
    The 'Format-Custom' & 'Format-List' views contain the largest amount
    of information regarding the symlink.


 == The module has the following default settings
    New profiles default being created at:
        '%APPDATA%\Powershell\FactorioProfiles\Profiles'
    New profiles don't share anything globally.

    These settings can be modified with the 'Set-FactorioProfileOption' cmdlet.



HOW IT WORKS
 == A Steam or standalone installation of the game stores it's data in the
    '%APPDATA%\Factorio' folder. What this module does is store the data in
    separate folders elsewhere on the filesystem, and then creating a
    symbolic link pointing to these folders.

    Example:
        %APPDATA%\Factorio -> D:\my\modded\factorio\profile

    The creation of this symbolic link is done through the
    'Switch-FactorioProfile' cmdlet, which will link to the given profile.


 == Whilst most of the sharing is done through symbolic links, the blueprint
    file isn't. Because of an apparent limitation of factorio this method
    does not work since factorio seems to completely delete and re-create
    the 'blueprint-storage.dat' file every time it is modified.

    Therefore, to "share" this file between multiple profiles, it must be
    copied between the profiles rather than linked.

 [!]Because of this limitation, if a profile is sharing blueprint data, you
    must run the 'Sync-FactorioProfiles' cmdlet once you exit out of the game.
    This will perform the copying for you and make it "seamless".



CREATING A PROFILE
 == To create a new profile, run:
    
        PS C:\> New-FactorioProfile -Name "modded"
    
    This command will create a new profile with the name "modded", and it will
    be created in the default profile location.

    -Name
        Specifies the name of the profile; must be unique.
    
    OPTIONAL PARAMETERS
    
    -Path
        Specifies the path at which to create the profile folder, overriding
        the default path. If any parent folders don't exist, they will be
        created during the execution.
    
    -ShareConfig (Accepted values: "true", "false")
        Specifies that this profile will share it's configuration file globally.
    
    -ShareMods (Accepted values: "true", "false")
        Specifies that this profile will share it's mods folder content
        globally.
    
    -ShareSaves (Accepted values: "true", "false")
        Specifies that this profile will share it's save folder content
        globally.
    
    -ShareScenarios (Accepted values: "true", "false")
        Specifies that this profile will share it's scenarios folder content
        globally.
    
    -ShareBlueprints (Accepted values: "true", "false")
        Specifies that this profile will share it's blueprint data file
        globally.



RETRIEVING A PROFILE
 == To retrieve the details of a profile, run:
    
        PS C:\> Get-FactorioProfile -Name "modded"
    
    This command will retrieve the details of the profile named "modded", and
    print the information to the screen.
    
    -Names
        Specifies the name(s) of the profiles to retrieve.
        Leaving this value blank will retrieve *all* profiles.
     [!]This parameter has tab-completion support.



RETRIEVING THE MODULE SETTINGS
 == To retrieve the global settings for this module, run:
    
        PS C:\> Get-FactorioProfileSettings
    
    This command will retrieve the module settings, and print them to
    the screen.



CHANGING THE OPTIONS OF A PROFILE
 == To modify a profile, run:
    
        PS C:\> Set-FactorioProfileOption -Profile "modded" -...
    
    This command will modify the "modded" profile.

    -Profile
        Specifies the name of the profile to modify.
     [!]This parameter has tab-completion support.
    
    OPTIONAL PARAMETERS

    -NewName
        Specifies the new name of the profile; must be unique.
      [!]Renaming the profile will rename the profile folder as well.
    
    -NewPath
        Specifies the new location of the profile; location must not be taken.

    -ShareConfig (Accepted values: "true", "false")
        Specifies that this profile will share it's configuration file globally.
    
    -ShareMods (Accepted values: "true", "false")
        Specifies that this profile will share it's mods folder content
        globally.
    
    -ShareSaves (Accepted values: "true", "false")
        Specifies that this profile will share it's save folder content
        globally.
    
    -ShareScenarios (Accepted values: "true", "false")
        Specifies that this profile will share it's scenarios folder content
        globally.
    
    -ShareBlueprints (Accepted values: "true", "false")
        Specifies that this profile will share it's blueprint data file
        globally.

 [!]Changing any of the "sharing" options will perform the following action:
    - If the profile is current not sharing but will now share,
      The current profile item *will be deleted*, and then the item will be
      shared.
    - If the profile is current sharing but will now not share,
      The item will stop being shared, and a new empty item will be created.
    

 == To modify the global settings for this module, run:
    
        PS C:\> Set-FactorioProfileOption -Module -...

    -Module
        Specifies that the cmdlet will modify the global settings.
    
    OPTIONAL PARAMETERS

    -DefaultPathForNewProfiles
        Specifies the path at which, by default, new profiles will be created.

    -ShareConfigByDefault (Accepted values: "true", "false")
        Specifies that by default, a new profile will share it's configuration
        file globally.
    
    -ShareModsByDefault (Accepted values: "true", "false")
        Specifies that by default, a new profile will share it's mods folder
        content globally.

        Specifies that by default, a new profile will share it's blueprint
        data file globally.	



SWITCHING TO A PROFILE
 == To switch Factorio to a profile, run:
    
        PS C:\> Switch-FactorioProfile -Name "modded"
    
    This command will make the profile named "modded" become the currently
    active Factorio profile. Once this command has finished execution, you
    can start Factorio up, whether through Steam or otherwise.

    -Name
        Specifies the name of the profile to switch to.
     [!]This parameter has tab-completion support.



SYNCING ALL PROFILES
 == To sync a given profiles blueprint data, run:
    
        PS C:\> Sync-FactorioProfiles

    This command will, if sharing blueprint data, sync this data with the
    "global" profile. This is a workaround to the limitations of Factorio.



OPENING A PROFILE FOLDER

        PS C:\> Open-FactorioProfileFolder -Name "modded"
    
    This command will open explorer.exe at the location of the profile folder
    for the "modded" profile.

    -Name
        Specifies the name of the profile to open.
     [!]This parameter has tab-completion support.



REMOVING A PROFILE
 == To retrieve the details of a profile, run:
    
        PS C:\> Remove-FactorioProfile -Name "modded"
    
    This command will remove the profile named "modded", including deleting
    the profile folder from disk.
    
    -Name
        Specifies the name of the profile to remove.
     [!]This parameter has tab-completion support.



OTHER
 == This module stores all data in the '%APPDATA%\Powershell\FactorioProfiles'
    folder. It is advised to **not** manually modify the database file as it
    could have unintended consequences.
